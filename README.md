# SimpleJSON
Simple JSON wrapper for Java

I made this JSON wrapper because the previous one I was using was causing me some problems to maintain my own code, so I decided to myself make one which better fits my needs.

I didn't work much on error handling so I don't know if this could cause trouble in some cases. Since this wrapper relies in while statements to read JSON, maybe this can lead to thread locks, but currently it's working fine on my projects.
